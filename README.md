ABC Company Employee Data Analysis
This repository contains a comprehensive analysis of ABC Company's employee dataset, which includes 458 records and 9 columns. The project involves preprocessing and analyzing the dataset to uncover key insights into employee distribution, demographics, and salary expenditure. Below is a summary of the tasks performed:

Project Overview:
The project was structured into two main phases: Preprocessing and Analysis.

1. Preprocessing:
Data Cleaning: The "height" column was identified to contain inconsistent or erroneous data. To correct this, the column was updated by replacing invalid entries with random height values ranging between 150 and 180 cm. This ensures data integrity before proceeding with analysis.
2. Analysis:
Employee Distribution Across Teams: The distribution of employees across different teams was analyzed. The number of employees in each team was determined, and the percentage split relative to the total number of employees was calculated.

Segregation by Position: Employees were categorized based on their respective positions within the company, allowing for an in-depth understanding of how employees are distributed across different roles.

Predominant Age Group: The dataset was examined to identify the predominant age group among employees, providing insights into the age demographics of the company.

Salary Expenditure by Team and Position: An analysis was conducted to determine which team and position incurred the highest salary expenditure. This was useful for understanding where the company’s salary budget is allocated.

Correlation Between Age and Salary: The relationship between employee age and salary was investigated, and a visual representation (scatter plot) was created to reveal any potential trends or patterns in the data.

Tools & Technologies Used:
Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib)
Google Colab for code execution and analysis
Git for version control
Data Insights:
This analysis provides valuable insights into the company’s structure, employee distribution, and salary trends. The results can help ABC Company optimize its staffing strategies and salary allocations for better efficiency and planning.
